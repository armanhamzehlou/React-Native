## Running React Native on Repl.it

### Create native apps for Android, iOS, and more using React

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) combines the best parts of native development with [React](https://reactjs.org/), a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

This template includes the [Expo SDK](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/) to make the development process easier. [Expo](https://expo.dev/) is a build tool that includes features like fast refresh, optimized builds, and the ability to create universal native apps that run on Android, iOS, and the web.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.js](#App.js) and watch it update live!

By default, Replit runs the `web` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the Expo docs for [developing native apps](https://docs.expo.dev/).
