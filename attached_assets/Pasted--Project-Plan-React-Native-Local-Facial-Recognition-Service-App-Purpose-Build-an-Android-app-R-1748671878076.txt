‚úÖ Project Plan: React Native Local Facial Recognition Service App
üß© Purpose
Build an Android app (React Native) that functions as a local facial recognition service:

It matches an input image (file path) against a local folder of face images (the face DB).

It responds with whether there is a match.

If a match is found, it returns the file name of the matched image.

üîÑ New Stack Decision
Feature	New Plan
Platform	React Native
Facial Recognition	Use a free SDK or library like Faceplugin React Native SDK or face-api.js ported via TensorFlow.js
Python	‚ùå Not using Chaquopy or DeepFace anymore
Offline Mode	‚úÖ All matching happens on-device
External Calls	‚úÖ Triggered via Intent, or custom URI scheme / Deep Link / Broadcast
Input Format	Absolute file path to an image (e.g. from camera or file picker)
DB of Faces	Local folder, e.g. /storage/emulated/0/FaceDB/
Output	JSON response:

json
Copy
Edit
{ "match": "yes", "filename": "zahra.jpg" }
or:

json
Copy

{ "match": "no" }
üèóÔ∏è Functional Requirements
Initialize Face DB

On app start, scan a local folder (e.g. /FaceDB/) and load all images into memory or index them.

Use embedded face embeddings for performance if supported.

Expose API to External Callers

Support image input from other apps using:

Custom Intent or BroadcastReceiver

Or deep link scheme like faceapp://match?path=/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/photo.jpg

Face Matching

When a new image is passed in:

Load and extract face embedding

Compare it with all embeddings in DB

If match (distance below threshold): return matched file name

Else: return no match

Return Result to Caller

Use Intent result, a notification, or REST-style response if using internal HTTP server (optional)

üß∞ Suggested Free SDKs / Libraries
Choose one of the following (sorted by ease of use and compatibility):

1. ‚úÖ Faceplugin React Native SDK
Fully free and open-source

Offline, runs on device

Face recognition and liveness detection

2. üß™ TensorFlow.js + face-api.js (ported to React Native)
Runs in WebView or using react-native-tensorflow-lite

May need performance tuning

3. ‚öôÔ∏è OpenCV with custom face recognition logic
Use react-native-opencv3 or native module

More work, but very customizable

üìù Example Intent Format (from another app)
javascript
Copy
Edit
Intent intent = new Intent("com.myfacematcher.MATCH");
intent.putExtra("imagePath", "/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/photo.jpg");
startActivityForResult(intent, 111);
Expected Response:

json
Copy
Edit
{ "match": "yes", "filename": "ali_face.jpg" }
or:

json
Copy
Edit
{ "match": "no" }
üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes
Use react-native-fs to scan and read files from device storage.

Handle runtime storage permissions.

Use background threads for face matching to avoid UI freezing.

Optional: build a debug UI to test face matching manually.
